GL Exercise
====
My playground for develop more understanding on shader language  
Environment used here is an OpenFrameworks app by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo which you can find source code [here](http://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/sNodes)

###My environment
worked with my OS X 10.8.4

###Usage
drag and drop the shader file into the app   
press "o" to open the current shader file  
live code and hit save to see result  
and shit your pant with your GL awesomeness
